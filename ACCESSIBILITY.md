## Areas Improved

### 1. Screen Reader Support (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- ✅ Added `accessibilityLabel` to all interactive elements

### 2. Touch Target Sizes
- ✅ Minimum 44x44pt for all buttons (iOS HIG / Android guidelines)
- ✅ Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- ✅ Large enough tap areas for grade buttons

### 3. Color Contrast
- ✅ All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large)
- ✅ Interactive elements have sufficient contrast
- ✅ Error states are distinguishable without color

### 4. Motion & Animation
- ✅ Respect `reduceMotion` preference (already in Flashcard)
- ✅ No auto-playing animations
- ✅ Essential info not conveyed through motion alone

### 5. Focus Management
- ✅ Logical tab order in forms
